### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a networking app called Myce, that acts as a framework for connecting rural communities together for access to and the sharing of information, resources, knowledge, etc, much like Mycellium, of which it is named after.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a variety of subjects via Promineo Tech's Front End Coding Bootcamp.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Myce, my app baby.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about literally anything, I'm sure I have knowledge on it, or opinions about it. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Any and All pronouns
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a Jane of All Trades out of the tech world. I'm a creative adventurist, I compose music, play a variety of instruments, write poetry/books/etc, graphic design, portraiture, drawing/painting/etc, and more.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently looking for work!
